### **Session-8 Assignment**

1. Go through this repository: https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar (Links to an external site.)
2. Extract the ResNet18 model from this repository and add it to your API/repo. 
3. Use your data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10
4. Your Target is 85% accuracy. No limit on the number of epochs. Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed). 
5. Once done finish S8-Assignment-Solution. 
 

### **These are the questions in S8-A-S**

1. Share the link to your GitHub S8 code. Please make sure it is public. If your code is not modular or structured into different functional files, you will get 0 for the whole submission.
2. What is the final accuracy of your model
3. Paste your training or epoch logs here

#### **RESULT**
GitHub Source: https://github.com/upadhyayprakash/eva4/tree/master/S8
- Accuracy after 17 Epochs: 84.17%
- Basic Augmentation Used: Random Horizontal Flip, Random Crop
